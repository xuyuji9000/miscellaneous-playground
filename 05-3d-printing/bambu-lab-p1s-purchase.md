Karl is planning to get one for his home, and potentially donate to XCJ in the future.

What are the factors should be considered to get a new Bambu Lab machine ?
- What are the materials do we expect to print?
- What is the 3D printing productivity difference between a XCJ Dremel machine and new Bambu Lab machine?

    > The Bambu Lab machine can be 2-3 times faster than the XCJ Dremel machine.
    > Carbon fiber 3D printing is not necessary.
